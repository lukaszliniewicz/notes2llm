Notes2LLM is a browser-based tool for post-processing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a visual interface for editing and refining AI-generated code without requiring manual text editing.

## Purpose

This tool helps bridge the gap between initial AI code generation and production-ready code, especially for users working with LLMs through chat interfaces rather than more expensive API integrations. It allows you to:

- Visually edit and test code before sending it back to an LLM for refinement
- Add specific comments targeted at particular elements to guide further LLM modifications
- Make quick adjustments without needing to understand the entire codebase
- Preview changes in real-time before implementing them

## How It Works

1. Generate initial code from any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) through chat or API
2. Copy and paste the code into Notes2LLM
3. Edit elements visually by clicking on them in the preview
4. Add revision comments directly before or after specific elements
5. Test functionality in preview mode
6. Copy the modified code and comments back to the LLM for refinement

Notes2LLM does not directly interface with any LLM systems - it functions as a standalone editing environment, requiring manual copying of code between systems.

## Key Features

- **Visual Editing**: Directly modify text content and image sources through a point-and-click interface
- **Contextual Comments**: Insert comments before or after specific elements to provide targeted feedback to LLMs
- **Element Management**: Duplicate or remove elements with single-click operations
- **CSS Control**: Edit styling directly with a visual interface without writing CSS code
- **HTML Editing**: Modify element markup with a real-time preview
- **Preview Mode**: Test interactions and functionality as an end-user would experience them
- **Prompt Generator**: Create effective prompts for generating code with LLMs

## For Less Experienced Users

Notes2LLM is particularly helpful for users with limited HTML/CSS experience by:
- Providing a visual interface to edit code without writing HTML/CSS directly
- Allowing quick previews of changes without setting up development environments
- Enabling specific feedback to LLMs without understanding complex code structures
- Simplifying the iterative refinement process with AI-generated code

## Prompt Generator

The integrated prompt generator helps create structured prompts for LLMs to generate high-quality code, specifying:

- Purpose (general HTML/CSS/JS, WordPress, email, etc.)
- Styling preferences (color schemes, typography, visual style)
- Elements to include (headers, images, galleries, sliders)
- Content structure and organization
- Responsiveness and accessibility requirements

This helps ensure the initial code from the LLM better matches your requirements, reducing the need for extensive revisions.

## Technical Details

- Runs entirely in your browser with no server-side processing
- All data remains on your device
- No installation required
- Compatible with code generated by any modern LLM
