# Notes2LLM

Notes2LLM is a browser-based tool for post-processing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It helps bridge the gap between LLM-generated code and implementation by providing a visual editor for quick modifications.

## Purpose

The tool addresses common challenges when working with LLM-generated code:

- Editing text content without modifying HTML structure
- Changing image source URLs to valid ones
- Adding notes/comments for LLMs when requesting refinements
- Duplicating or removing elements
- Modifying CSS styles with instant visual feedback
- Testing JavaScript interactions

## Features

- Visual editing of HTML elements with real-time preview
- Direct text content editing
- Image source URL modification
- Element duplication and removal
- HTML comments insertion for LLM refinement instructions
- Class and ID manipulation
- CSS rule creation and editing
- HTML source editing for selected elements
- Preview mode to test interactive elements
- Code export for re-submission to LLMs

## How to Use

1. **Generate code** from your preferred LLM assistant
   - For best results, ask for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single code block
   - Example prompt: "Please give me a single code block with HTML, CSS (in style tags), and JS (in script tags) for..."

2. **Paste the code** into Notes2LLM
   - Or use the integrated prompt generator to create effective LLM prompts

3. **Edit and annotate**
   - Click on elements to select them for editing
   - Use the toolbar to modify, duplicate, or comment on elements
   - Edit CSS rules in the sidebar
   - Test interactions with preview mode

4. **Export the modified code**
   - Click "Get Processed Code" to export your changes
   - The code includes your HTML edits, CSS rules, and original JS
   - Send back to the LLM with your comments for further refinement
